Based on wordclock from (find link)
my C++ skills are terrible therefore the code is as is - i do not take any responsibility for broken led cubes or d1 minis :P
Features:
uses the async web server implementation for esp8266 which is just amazing
works over wifi
animations: 
rise, fall, say a string, say a char
  all with parameters: how fast, and on which led layer to display
 
OTA upgrades

TODOS:
the cube might crash on some animations as they are buggy
time animation - both binary and somehow digital
ntp! as I broke it somehow
offline support
misconfiguration display - no wifi, needs password, welcome, etc.. i think i got the pictures, but they don't work
